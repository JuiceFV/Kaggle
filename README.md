# Kaggle

The reposetory itself contains all projects, competitions and datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). I'm gonna to to replenish this repos with new projects.

## List of projects

- [x] [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic): Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. ([Solution](https://github.com/JuiceFV/Kaggle/tree/master/Titanik))
- [ ] [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer): In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

## Results

- **Titanic**: In this project I researched some linear algorithms such as **Gradient Boosting Classifier**,  **Linear Discriminant Analysis**, **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, **Gaussian Naive Bayes**, **Support Vector Machine** and many others. Also, I tried to apply some statistic analysis to every issue I encountered. The best score, I recieved so far is **0.77990**. This score gives me the [Linear Discriminant Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis)
